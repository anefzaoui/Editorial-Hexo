# Editorial Hexo

Editorial Hexo is originally HTML5UP free, and open source HTML5 template that I like, given that I also like Hexo as a static website generator. I thought I'd transform the HTML5 template into a Hexo theme.

## Status

### How far is it done?

It is incomplete. It shows pages, posts, and menus correctly but it is far from over.

If you happen to stumble upon this and want to help out adding a feature or two; please do!

### When will it be done?

Soon, most likely. But fair warning I got lots of things happening that I might take some time between commits. Although I'll try my best because I also plan to use it as well for my personal blog.
